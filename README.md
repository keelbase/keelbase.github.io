# Agent1c.me

Agent1c.me is a serverless, AI-enabled browser OS built on HedgeyOS (`hedgeyos.github.io`).

It runs entirely inside a browser tab with no app server. If the tab stays open, Hitomi can keep running autonomous loops and can control a Telegram bot through the configured Bot API token. If the tab closes, runtime stops.

No logins, no installations, just API attach.

## What It Is

- Local-first autonomous agent workspace inside a retro web desktop
- Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK): OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI (Grok), z.ai, and Telegram credentials are user-provided
- Vault encryption in-browser for stored provider credentials
- Direct provider calls from browser to provider APIs
- No backend required for MVP

## Built On HedgeyOS

This project is built on HedgeyOS and reuses its browser OS foundations:

- Window manager and desktop shell
- Menubar and app-launch model
- Theme system
- IndexedDB-backed local persistence patterns

Agent1c.me and HedgeyOS are both by Decentricity.

## Core Capabilities

- Top-level agent windows in HedgeyOS (Chat, AI APIs, Telegram API, Loop, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, heartbeat.md, Events)
- Dedicated `Shell Relay` window (separate from Config) for localhost shell bridge setup and controls
- Local threaded chat with rolling context
- Per-thread memory for local chats
- Per-chat-id memory isolation for Telegram chats
- Heartbeat loop and event timeline
- Tile and Arrange window controls in the menubar
- Multi-provider runtime routing:
  - OpenAI (`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`)
  - Anthropic (`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`)
  - xAI Grok (`https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions`)
  - z.ai (`https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`)

## Onboarding Flow

1. First load: only `Create Vault` is shown.
2. After vault creation: `OpenAI API` and `Events` are shown.
3. User must complete OpenAI setup:
   - Save encrypted OpenAI key
   - Test OpenAI connection
   - Save OpenAI settings (model and temperature)
4. After setup is complete, OpenAI window minimizes and the rest of the agent workspace appears.
5. Telegram setup is optional, but required for Telegram bot bridging.

## Security Model (MVP)

- Credentials are encrypted at rest in-browser
- Vault unlock is passphrase-based
- No third-party app login flow required for MVP
- Provider secrets are not sent to any agent1c server because there is no agent1c server in this architecture

## Runtime Notes

- Agent runtime is tab-bound.
- Locking vault protects secret access, while loop intent can continue and resume API work after unlock.
- Telegram bridge runs only when enabled and when required credentials are available.

## Shell Relay (Phase 1)

- `Shell Relay` is a separate HedgeyOS window, not a Config subsection.
- It provides OS-first setup instructions (Linux, macOS, Android) with copyable code blocks.
- Relay runtime is shell-only in this phase:
  - `shell-relay/install.sh`
  - `shell-relay/agent1c-relay.sh`
  - `shell-relay/handler.sh`
- New tool in TOOLS: `shell_exec`.

### Tor Relay (HTTP fetch transport option)

- `Tor Relay` is a separate HedgeyOS window in `.me` that mirrors the Shell Relay UX.
- v1 scope:
  - Linux + macOS setup only
  - uses the same localhost relay runtime
  - runs as a separate relay instance (default `127.0.0.1:8766`) so Shell Relay can stay online on `8765`
  - Tor routing applies to relay HTTP fetch path only
  - shell command execution remains local and unchanged
- Relay scripts support proxy mode via:
  - `AGENT1C_RELAY_HTTP_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050`
- Relay exposes `GET /v1/tor/status` for Tor verification checks.

## AI Provider Architecture

- Provider setup is unified in the `AI APIs` window:
  - Select a provider card
  - Save encrypted key
  - Provider key validation runs immediately
  - On success, provider can become active
  - Model selection is stored per provider
- Active provider controls local chat, heartbeat responses, and Telegram replies.
- Onboarding continues when at least one AI provider key is valid.

## Grok Integration Notes

- xAI (Grok) is fully wired, not preview-only.
- Supported fallback models currently shown in UI:
  - `grok-4`
  - `grok-3`
  - `grok-3-mini`
- Key validation is live using xAI API calls.
- xAI status and key/model controls follow the same card behavior as Anthropic and z.ai.

## How To Add Another Provider

1. Add provider state fields (`key`, `model`, `validated`) to preview/provider state.
2. Add provider card UI in `AI APIs` window and wire card DOM IDs.
3. Add provider chat function (endpoint + headers + response parsing).
4. Add provider validation function and include it in `validateProviderKey(...)`.
5. Include provider in:
   - provider normalization
   - display name mapping
   - active runtime secret resolution
   - provider badge/pill refresh
   - onboarding key checks
   - lock/unlock UI disable handling
6. Route chat/heartbeat/Telegram through the unified provider runtime path.
7. Keep wording aligned: avoid "Preview" once provider is fully wired.

## Local Run

```bash
cd agent1c-me.github.io
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Live

- Production domain: `https://agent1c.me`
- GitHub Pages repo: `https://github.com/agent1c-me/agent1c-me.github.io`

## Development Notes

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no npm dependency chain)
- Changes should preserve HedgeyOS baseline behavior unless intentionally modified
- Integration notes and guardrails are documented in `agents.md`

## Cross-Repo Diff Map

- `.me` vs `.ai` behavior map (sovereign reference): `LOCAL_VS_CLOUD_DIFF.md`
- Reciprocal map in cloud repo: `../agent1c-ai.github.io/CLOUD_VS_LOCAL_DIFF.md`

## Proxy Browsing Status (Existing vs Next)

### Existing features (implemented)

- Hedgey Browser has relay routing controls with route modes:
  - `🖧` direct first + Shell Relay fallback
  - `🧅` direct first + Tor Relay fallback
  - purple `🧅` Tor-first/force mode
- Shell Relay (`8765`) and Tor Relay (`8766`) can run at the same time.
- `Use Experimental Web Proxy` toggle exists in both Shell Relay and Tor Relay windows and stays synced.
- Relay supports full-proxy endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/proxy/page`
  - `GET /v1/proxy/asset`
- Browser can use proxy page mode as relay fallback (experimental proxy ON).
- Proxy rewriting currently supports:
  - canonical link click handoff (browser field stays on real target URL)
  - universal GET form-submit bridge (including scripted submit paths)
  - `srcset` rewriting
  - CSS `url(...)` and `@import` rewriting
- Proxy hardening already applied:
  - recursive proxy rewrite guards
  - canonical form action handling (avoid `/v1/proxy/page?...` without `url=`)
  - no browser-side double-fetch preflight (Yahoo regression avoided)

### To be implemented for proxy browsing (next phase)

- P2.2 anti-bot detection + HedgeyOS-native warning dialog on proxy path (single-fetch only).
- Proxy status/title UX polish after proxied navigation and form submits.
- Saved-app proxy correctness:
  - always store original URL
  - reopen via current route mode without blank-app regressions.
- More compatibility work for complex sites:
  - graceful POST form behavior
  - redirect/canonicalization edge cases
  - additional asset/CSS rewrite edge cases
- Later (shared with `.ai` design): full Cloudflare Worker proxy backend for managed browsing transport.
